# Technology

Technology within the context of the "Dojo" knowledge base is conceptualized as a structured, multilayered entity, adopting a unique approach towards understanding and categorizing various technological elements involved in software development. Through a prismatic lens of 'Technology Cubism,' we examine technology as "components," each having many layers and interacting across distinct, predefined dimensions. The aim here is not to classify technology but to deeply understand its inherent multifaceted interactions, integrations, and functionalities in a structured manner.

## Ring

A "ring" is a classification category that reflects the level of maturity and the organization's readiness or suitability to adopt a particular technology, technique, or tool. Each ring in the Tech Radar represents a different recommendation status for adopting these items based on the organization's assessment of their potential and proven effectiveness.

## Type

The type represents a logical categorization of technological components based on their primary function and phase in an operational cycle. This encompasses all stages from conceptualizing and planning (Design) to actualizing and implementing (Development), and finally, delivering and utilizing (Execution) the technology.
