title: Ring
---
In the context of the knowledge base, "ring" refers to a critical category that determines the stage of maturity and acceptance of technology within an organization. This concept indicates the level of development and stability of a technology, as well as the readiness and ability of the company to integrate it into its processes and projects.

The ring is a classification tool that guides organizations in their approach to various technologies. It allows companies to evaluate the position of a technology in its lifecycle, considering whether it is ready for widespread adoption, requires more research or its use should be limited or approached with caution.

Each ring represents a level of commitment and confidence in the technology:

- [[adopt|ADOPT]]. High confidence and recommendation for extensive use.
- [[trial|TRIAL]]. Recognition of its potential, but needs more research.
- [[assess|ASSESS]]. Active experimentation is suggested to assess its usefulness.
- [[hold|HOLD]]. Limited use, generally due to obsolescence or the existence of better options.

Additionally, the category [[none|NONE]] is assigned to technologies in the early stages of exploration and has yet to be classified into a specific Ring.
