The Husky project is a development tool designed to streamline and automate the process of pre-commit and pre-push Git hooks. It facilitates the enforcement of code quality checks, ensuring that only validated code gets committed or pushed to a repository. By integrating Husky into a project, developers can configure tasks such as linting, testing, or other custom scripts to run automatically before commits or pushes are finalized. This capability can lead to more consistent codebases and reduce the likelihood of problematic code making it into the repository. Husky is widely used in software development environments to improve workflow efficiency and maintain code integrity. It is compatible with various programming languages and easily integrates with existing development tools and frameworks.
