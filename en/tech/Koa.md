Expressive HTTP middleware framework for [[Node.js]] to make web applications and APIs more enjoyable to write. Koa's middleware stack flows in a stack-like manner, allowing you to perform actions downstream and then filter and manipulate the response upstream.

Only methods common to nearly all HTTP servers are integrated directly into Koa's small ~570 SLOC codebase. This includes content negotiation, normalization of node inconsistencies, redirection, and a few others.

Koa is not bundled with any middleware.
