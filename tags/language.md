Programming languages define the syntax and structure, forming the backbone of source code logic. It sets the fundamental rules and boundaries within which programmers express logic and functionality. Like a spoken language shapes communication, programming languages shape how developers conceive, construct, and refine their code. This definition of syntax and structure is crucial in determining how effectively and efficiently a program operates, directly impacting its performance, readability, and maintainability.
