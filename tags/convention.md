title: Conventions
---
Conventions in programming are akin to the rules of grammar in a language. They comprise a set of non-functional rules and standards that guide the structuring and readability of source code without altering its core logic. These conventions cover various coding practices, from naming and formatting to architectural and design principles. Implicitly, they also encompass the orderly progression and tracking of code development, ensuring that each contribution to the codebase is coherent and aligns with the overall project goals.
