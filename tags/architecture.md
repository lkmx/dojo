Architecture in software development encompasses theories and guidelines that dictate how individual software components should interact with each other. This architectural framework ensures that each component functions harmoniously within a larger ecosystem, facilitating efficient data flow, scalability, and robustness. Sound architectural principles are vital to building resilient, flexible, and coherent software systems that adapt to evolving requirements and technological advancements.
