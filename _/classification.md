# Classification

The technology landscape is vast and varied, with numerous components working in tandem to bring ideas to life. A useful way to understand and categorize these components is to view them through the lens of their primary function and phase in an operational cycle. This approach can be divided into three primary stages: Design, Development, and Execution. While this classification originated in the software domain, its versatility provides clarity across various technological contexts.

## Lifecycle

### **Design**: The Conception Phase

In the design phase, the focus is on conceptualizing and planning a solution. Here, the foundation is laid for what will eventually become tangible software or technology.

- **Languages**: These define the syntax and structure, shaping the logic of the source code.
  
- **Conventions**: Non-functional rules and standards that guide but do not alter the logic of the source code.

- **Blueprints**: Fundamental theories, guidelines, or doctrines that steer the design of a software component's source code.

- **Architectures**: These theories and guidelines determine how a software component should interact with other components.

### **Development**: The Creation Phase

Once the foundation is set, the development phase begins. The concepts transition from theory to practice, transforming ideas into functional software or tech components.

- **Frameworks**: These are structured guidelines or rule sets that aid in efficiently creating solutions.

- **Libraries**: Collections of resources, such as code or assets, designed to augment the source code.

- **Builders**: Systems or tools that compile source code or mold it into a functional software component.

- **Interpreters**: Tools or systems that interpret source or byte code, bringing a software component to life.

### **Execution**: The Implementation Phase

In the execution phase, software components are deployed and utilized. This is where they interact, function, and provide their intended value within a larger system or as standalone entities.

- **Platforms**: Environments or systems in which software components are hosted and run. They provide the necessary infrastructure for the components to operate seamlessly.
    
- **Tools**: Standalone utility software components designed for specific tasks. Once executed, they complete their designated function and deliver the intended outcome, streamlining or automating particular processes within the larger system.
    
- **Services**: Software entities that deliver predefined functionalities. They operate autonomously, offering services without requiring deep interaction or understanding of their underlying mechanisms.
    
- **Stores**: Software repositories or systems that manage, store, and retrieve data or other software resources.
    
- **Extensions**: Software add-ons or modifications that amplify or modify the capabilities of an existing component, be it a system, tool, service, or store.
