# Technology

"Technology" within the context of the "Dojo" knowledge base is conceptualized as a structured, multilayered entity, adopting a unique approach towards understanding and categorizing various technological elements involved in software development. Through a prismatic lens of 'Technology Cubism,' we examine technology as "components," each having many layers and interacting across distinct, predefined dimensions. The aim here is not to classify technology but to deeply understand its inherent multifaceted interactions, integrations, and functionalities in a structured manner.

The categories explored herein - Design, Development, Execution, and Extension - represent a logical segregation of technological components based on their role and phase in the development cycle. From the establishment of structural and functional paradigms (Design) to the creation (Development), deployment (Execution), and augmentation (Extension) of software, each phase hosts certain technological entities with distinct roles, elucidated further in their respective segments.

### Design

- **[[language]]**: Syntax that dictates the structure of the source code that generates components.
- **[[principle]]**: Foundational theories or doctrines guiding the internal structure of components and/or how the components expose their functions to the outside.
- **[[architecture]]**: Structural blueprints guiding the composition and interaction of software components.

### Development

- **[[framework]]**: Coupled components providing foundational functionalities for development.
- **[[compiler]]**: Transform source code into an executable or interpretable component.
- **[[library]]**: Reusable, pre-compiled code enhancing functionality and development efficiency.
- **[[tool]]**: Assist by automating or facilitating specific tasks or operations.

### Execution

- **[[platform]]**: Environments that host and facilitate the execution of software components.
- **[[service]]**: Autonomous components providing specific functionalities without exposing internal workings.
- **[[store]]**: Entities that manage, store, and retrieve data for software.
- **[[plugin]]**: Components enhancing or modifying the functionalities of existing software.
