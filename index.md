Dojo is the technology knowledge base of LKMX.

In Dojo, technological understanding is addressed through an intuitive model that comprises three elements: type, ring, and training.

The [[Type]] assigns each technology a specific function within a well-defined operational lifecycle, which unfolds through the design, development, and operation stages. This classification makes it easier to identify and place each technology in the context of a broad collection, using its function as a guide to navigating a diverse and constantly evolving technological landscape.

The [[Ring]] represents the maturity of the technology and our organizational capacity to assimilate it. Inspired by the principles of the Tech Radar, this element distinguishes the degree of technological readiness and appropriation, significantly simplifying analysis and improving strategic decision-making. It allows us to determine the opportune moment and the ideal way to integrate technological innovations into our workflows and projects.

Training focuses on active learning and solving specific technological challenges. We prioritize learning through practice, strengthening an analytical and creative approach to problem-solving. This applied learning allows us to stay up-to-date and competitive in the face of the industry's rapid evolution.
