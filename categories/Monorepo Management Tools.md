Monorepo Management Tools are tools designed to maintain repositories that contain multiple components. The main problems that these tools solve are:

- Streamlining codebase organization and ensuring consistency across multiple projects within a single repository.
- Facilitating easier code sharing and reuse among different teams and projects.
- Enhancing overall project visibility and traceability, making it simpler to track changes and dependencies.
- Providing a unified platform for continuous integration and deployment, which improves development workflows.
- Reducing the complexity associated with managing multiple repositories by centralizing version control and project management.
