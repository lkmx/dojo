JavaScript template engines are tools used in web development to dynamically generate HTML content. They allow developers to write templates with placeholders and logic, which are then filled with data to produce final rendered HTML. This process simplifies the creation of dynamic web pages, especially when dealing with complex user interfaces and data-driven applications.
