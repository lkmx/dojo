# Svelte

A modern frontend framework for building user interfaces. Unlike traditional frameworks that do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step when you build your app, resulting in highly performant and smaller JavaScript bundles. Its syntax is concise, making it easy to read and write, and it does not rely on a virtual DOM.
