Svelte is an innovative open-source framework for building user interfaces. It introduces a unique approach where components are compiled at build time, resulting in highly efficient vanilla JavaScript that directly manipulates the DOM rather than relying on a virtual DOM.

Svelte is straightforward, offering a clean and concise syntax that enhances developer productivity. It surpasses traditional frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular by eliminating the runtime overhead and delivering near-instantaneous performance. With features like built-in reactivity, no virtual DOM, and a leaner codebase, Svelte provides a streamlined and intuitive way to craft web applications.
