The Google JavaScript Style Guide is a set of coding conventions and guidelines for writing JavaScript code. It's designed to improve code readability and consistency across various JavaScript projects. This style guide covers various aspects of JavaScript programming, including naming conventions, code formatting, best practices, and programming patterns. It also addresses specific language features and how they should be used or avoided. The guide is intended for developers working on projects that adhere to its rules, and it serves as a reference for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient JavaScript code in line with Google's coding standards.

The Google JavaScript Style Guide differs from other JavaScript style guides in its specific conventions and preferences. It emphasizes readability, maintainability, and Google-specific best practices, often with a more stringent and detailed approach. It includes Google's unique naming conventions, specific code formatting rules, and particular choices in language features. While other guides like Airbnb's or StandardJS might focus more on community standards or simplicity, Google's guide is tailored to align with the company's internal coding philosophy and practices, which may be more detailed and structured than the more generalized approach in other JavaScript style guides.
