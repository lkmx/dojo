Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts system access to authorized users based on their roles within an organization. It is a widely adopted model for managing user permissions in a systematic and scalable way. In RBAC, access rights are grouped by roles, and users are assigned to these roles, inheriting the role's permissions. This approach simplifies permissions management, as administrators can control access on a role level rather than individual users. Roles are defined based on the responsibilities and authority levels of different users within the organization. For example, a manager might have different access rights than a regular employee. RBAC is effective in reducing the administrative workload and complexity associated with managing permissions for a large number of users. It also enhances security by ensuring that users only have the access necessary to perform their jobs, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
