Although yarn is fast and the new version seems to be incredible polished, it's not yet well integrated in the development environment and is perceived slower than its concurrent version of [[npm]].

Yarn is an established open-source package manager used to manage dependencies in JavaScript projects. It assists with the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing packages dependencies, eventually helping you reach the development objectives faster with fewer distractions.
