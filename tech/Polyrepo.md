## Introduction
Polyrepo architecture, also known as a "multiple repository" system, represents an alternative approach to code management in software development. Unlike Monorepo, where all code is stored in a single centralized repository, Polyrepo involves organizing different projects or components into separate repositories. This decentralized structure provides flexibility, allowing each project to have its independent versioning and management.
## Advantages
The Polyrepo model offers distinct advantages in specific contexts. Its decentralized nature facilitates **modular code management**, enabling teams to work on individual projects independently. This autonomy can enhance **code isolation**, ensuring that changes in one project do not directly impact others. Additionally, Polyrepo supports **scalability**, making it easier to manage a large number of projects across diverse teams. While it might not offer the same level of centralization as Monorepo, Polyrepo's flexibility suits scenarios where distinct projects demand separate repositories and individualized development strategies.
