## Introduction

Polyrepo architecture, a multiple repository system, represents an alternative approach to code management in software development. Unlike Monorepo, where all code is stored in a single centralized repository, Polyrepo organizes different projects or components into separate repositories. This decentralized structure provides flexibility, allowing each project independent versioning and management.

## Advantages

The Polyrepo model offers distinct advantages in specific contexts. Its decentralized nature facilitates modular code management, enabling teams to work on individual projects independently. This autonomy can enhance code isolation, ensuring that changes in one project do not directly impact others. Polyrepo also supports scalability, making managing many projects across diverse teams easier. While it might not offer the same level of centralization as Monorepo, Polyrepo's flexibility suits scenarios where distinct projects demand separate repositories and individualized development strategies.
