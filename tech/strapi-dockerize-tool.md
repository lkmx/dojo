Strapi Dockerize Tool is a specialized utility software component designed to streamline the process of containerizing Strapi applications using Docker. Strapi, an open-source headless content management system (CMS), facilitates the creation and management of content through a customizable API. The Dockerize Tool addresses explicitly the need to deploy Strapi applications in Docker containers, a practice that enhances portability, scalability, and consistency across different computing environments. By leveraging Docker, a leading platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, standalone packages known as containers, this tool enables developers to encapsulate Strapi applications and their dependencies in a standardized unit.
