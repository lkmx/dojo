TSDX is currently without maintenance.

TSDX is a developer tool focused on simplifying the process of building and maintaining TypeScript libraries. Created with the intention of streamlining the development workflow, TSDX automates various tasks such as bundling, linting, and testing, which are essential for library development. It offers a zero-config setup, meaning developers can start building their TypeScript libraries right away without the need for intricate configuration. This approach significantly reduces the time and effort required to set up a new project, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with setup and configuration.

A key feature of TSDX is its opinionated but customizable nature. It provides sensible defaults for tools like Rollup, Jest, and Prettier, ensuring a smooth development experience. However, it also allows for customization to cater to specific project requirements. This balance between convenience and flexibility makes TSDX highly adaptable for various types of TypeScript library projects. Moreover, TSDX includes optimizations for smaller bundle sizes and faster execution, which are critical for library efficiency. As a standalone utility tool, TSDX enhances the TypeScript development ecosystem by making library creation more accessible and efficient.
