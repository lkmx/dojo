Mustache is a web template system with implementations available for multiple languages. It is characterized by its simplicity and adherence to logic-less templates, meaning it allows for separation of the template from the underlying programming logic. Mustache templates are ideal for creating clean, maintainable, and reusable HTML or other text-based formats. The system uses tags enclosed in double curly braces, such as `{{username}}`, to dynamically insert data into a static template. This approach ensures that the templates remain straightforward and easily understandable, while the programming logic responsible for rendering the data is kept separate, promoting better organization and readability in the code. Mustache's versatility and language-agnostic design make it a popular choice for web developers seeking a flexible and efficient way to manage web templates.
