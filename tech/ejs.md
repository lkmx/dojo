EJS, or Embedded JavaScript, combines the familiarity of HTML with the power of JavaScript, allowing developers to embed JavaScript code directly into HTML-like templates. This approach is intuitive for those already versed in HTML and JavaScript, making EJS an accessible choice for a wide range of developers. It's particularly popular in Node.js environments for server-side rendering, but its straightforward nature makes it versatile for various applications. EJS doesn't enforce any strict structure, offering flexibility but requiring developers to be disciplined in organizing their templates.
