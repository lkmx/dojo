**SQLite** is a lightweight, open-source relational database management system. Unlike other systems, SQLite doesn't need a separate server and integrates directly into applications. It's ideal for resource-constrained applications and finds extensive use in mobile devices, web browsers, and embedded systems due to its efficiency and easy implementation.
