Pug is a high-performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers.

It uses a clean, whitespace-sensitive syntax for writing HTML. Pug's syntax is characterized by its use of indentation rather than closing tags, making templates more readable and concise.
