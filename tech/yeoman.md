Yeoman is an open-source, command-line tool that serves as a scaffolding system for modern web applications. It helps developers kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to stay productive. With a workflow that combines various tools and frameworks, Yeoman streamlines the setup of a project. It leverages a robust ecosystem of generators, which are essentially plugins, to provide boilerplate code for numerous frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, and more. Yeoman automates tedious tasks, ensures consistent structure, and integrates with build processes, making it an invaluable asset for front-end developers seeking efficiency and scalability in their development process.
