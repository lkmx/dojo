Handlebars is a popular template engine that extends the Mustache templating language. Its philosophy centers around minimal logic in templates, aiming for a clear separation of presentation and logic. This is achieved through a simple templating syntax with placeholders and basic conditional and iteration statements. Handlebars' simplicity makes it an excellent choice for developers who prefer to keep their HTML and JavaScript logic somewhat separated, reducing the risk of overly complex templates. It's widely used in various JavaScript frameworks and environments for its straightforwardness and compatibility.
