Access Control is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. It is fundamental to information security and data protection, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can access specific data or resources. Access control mechanisms are designed to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These mechanisms can be based on various models, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), each with its specific approach to defining and enforcing access permissions. Effective access control is crucial to protect sensitive information and maintain operational security.
