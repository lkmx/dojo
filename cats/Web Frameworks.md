Web frameworks are software libraries designed to support the development of web applications, web services, and web resources. They provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web. These frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with everyday activities performed in web development. They often promote code reuse and encompass preset configurations to handle essential website functions like managing sessions, taking requests and responses, and interacting with databases. Each framework typically follows a specific architectural pattern, like MVC (Model-View-Controller), and is designed for a specific programming language or environment, offering a unique blend of features, optimizations, and integrations.
